Before I was at [Fraunhofer IDMT](www.idmt.fraunhofer.de) as a research student for the project [Songs2See](http://songs2see.com), completed an M.Sc. in Media Technology at [TU Ilmenau](www.tu-ilmenau.de/mt) with a focus on audio coding and analysis, and a diploma in mathematics at [Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg](https://www.mathinf.uni-heidelberg.de/). Besides music analysis and processing, I'm also interested in speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. You can find some of my private projects at @mleimeister.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nRichard Vogl, Matthias Leimeister, Carthach O Nuanain, Sergi Jorda, Michael Hlatky, Peter Knees: An Intelligent Interface for Drum Pattern Variation and Comparative Evaluation of Algorithms.
